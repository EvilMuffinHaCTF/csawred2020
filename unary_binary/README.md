The name of the challenge implies that it is ternary, or base 3.  
After copying the pdf into a [text file](text.txt), and assuming  
"t" is the delimiter (due to the description), we try all possibilities and see
that  
`p = 1, r = 0, s = 2` gives ascii values. Decoding gives the flag:
`flag{n1c3_RPS_sk1llz}`
